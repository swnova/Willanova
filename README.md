# Module 2 Challenge : Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

## Description

In this project we are tasked with designing an HTML page for the purpose of displaying our future applications, and showcasing our work.

User Story :
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

Acceptance Criteria :
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport


### Updates/future developments
This is an updated version of my portfolio.
UI has been fixed, and a link to one other application has been added.
I will add more examples of my work in a future update, as well as tidy up some of the design elements.
